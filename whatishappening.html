                <p>Wildfires are large fires that spread quickly and are 
                out of control in wild landscapes. They start in one of 
                two ways: naturally or at the hands of humans.</p>

                <p>Natural wildfires are mostly caused by lightning and 
                sometimes by volcanic eruptions. Other times, they are 
                caused by the spontaneous combustion of dry fuels such 
                as dead leaves and twigs, but this is rare.</p>
                    
                <p>Humans can start wildfires accidentally with careless 
                campfires or sparks from machinery. Many are started 
                intentionally like some of the wildfires in the Amazon 
                rainforest. In the USA, approximately 90% of wildfires 
                are caused by humans.</p>
