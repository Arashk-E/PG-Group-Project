                <p>Limiting greenhouse gases emissions by reducing the 
                amount of fossil fuel being consumed by switching to 
                alternative methods like green energy or finding other 
                methods to travel. Saving water reduces the amount of 
                pollution by carbon as it takes a lot of energy to pump, 
                treat and even heat up the water. Eating less meat and 
                consuming all the food you buy is important as it requires 
                energy to raise the animals and grow the food as well as 
                the process of getting it to markets. </p>
                <p>Protecting marine and coastal ecosystems by conserving 
                and protecting marine habitats will help regulate 
                human activity in those areas and reduce the amount of 
                harm towards wildlife and ecosystems.</p>
                <p>Increasing scientific research will make sure 
                governments can invest in scientific research to monitor 
                the ocean and observe the effect on it. Having more 
                accurate data allows for humans to implement sufficient 
                plans to preserve and reduce the harm being done.</p>
