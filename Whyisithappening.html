                <p>There are several reasons for wildfires getting worse. 
                Since the beginning of the industrial era in 1760 Earth's 
                temperature has increased by almost 2Â°C. This is having a 
                progressively drastic impact on nature, including an increase 
                in extreme weather such as hurricanes and typhoons.</p>

                <p>While some areas are drowned by severe flooding, others 
                are parched by droughts. This means many previously lush 
                landscapes - including vegetation that can usually withstand 
                fire - are drying out, which increases the amount of fuel 
                for wildfires to consume.</p>
                    
                <p>Another reason for the increase in wildfires is that 
                humans are expanding to wild landscapes that are beautiful 
                but prone to fire. California is a great example. It was 
                once a rich landscape that burned regularly, replenishing 
                ecosystems and creating a haven for thousands of uniquely 
                adapted species. Over time, it became a favourable habitat 
                for humans, who have fragmented the landscape by building 
                roads and houses.</p>
